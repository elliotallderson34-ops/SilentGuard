# SilentGuard
“At 18, I taught myself Python and stepped into the world of cybersecurity — not to attack, but to defend. This repository is a forge of tools built to expose vulnerabilities, harden systems, and turn weak points into walls. Every script here reflects curiosity turned into resilience, and resilience turned into strength. Welcome to the arsenal.”
